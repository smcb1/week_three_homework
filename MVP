CodeClan Cinema (CCC (again))
Create a system that handles bookings for our newly built cinema! We want you to be able to check that all the methods you write can work in Pry - please do not spend time creating a Runner file or User Interface.

Your app should have:

Customers
  name
  funds

Films
  title
  price

Tickets
  customer_id
  film_id


Your app should be able to:
Create customers, films and tickets
CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.
Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film. At least one of these should return the data ordered by a property (customers or films ordered by name/title, for instance).

Basic extensions:
Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price
Check how many tickets were bought by a customer
Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film

Advanced extensions:
Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing
Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film
Limit the available tickets for screenings.
Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!
